    "> A data pipeline is a sequence of steps (more generally a directed acyclic graph) with integrated storage at each step. These steps may be thought of as nodes in a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is an accurate description, it may not be a most intuitive definition of what exactly a data pipeline is. Put succinctly, a data pipeline is a listing or a \"map\" of various \"things\" that you work with in a project, with line connecting things to indicate their dependecies. The \"things\" in a data pipeline tends to be the *nouns* you find when describing a project. The \"things\" may include anything from mouse, experimenter, equipment, to experiment session, trial, two-photon scans, electric activities, to receptive fields, neuronal spikes, to figures for publication! A data pipeline gives you a framework to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. define these \"things\" as tables in which you can store the information about them\n",
    "2. define the relationships (in particular the dependencies) between the \"things\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A data pipeline can then serve as a map that describes everything that goes on in your experiment, describing what is collected, what is processed, and what is analyzed/computed. A well designed data pipeline not only let's you organize your data well, but can bring out logical clarity to your experiment, and may even bring about new insights by making how everything in your experiment relates together.\n",
